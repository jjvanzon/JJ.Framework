### ðŸ“¦ JJ.Framework

- Pre-release versions of `JJ.Framework` components may be used.
- Those are currently hosted in *Azure DevOps*:
- https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/jjvanzon/1de16010-421a-41a5-90f1-86e9513f2c5b/_packaging/JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed/nuget/v3/index.json
- Name: JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed
- It might require configuring *NuGet* in your dev environment to connect to this additional package source.

`JJ.Framework` was once part of a larger code base. It was extracted to become a new Git repository with history in tact. Some quirks when checking out older history items, still have to do with that.

Sometimes commit comments may mention *apps* that do not seem to be relevant to the `JJ.Framework`. That is because changes to `JJ.Framework` were in service of making a feature in another app.

The following may only be relevant when getting older commits from history (from before 2018-12-02).
