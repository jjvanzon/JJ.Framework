JJ.Framework.PlatformCompatibility.Core
=======================================

Legacy component. A lingering relic for platform support, created before `.NET Standard` and `.NET 5` made things easier. It offers workarounds for compatibility issues on platforms like `iOS`, `Android`, and even `Windows Phone 8`. Mostly outdated now, but still linked to by various projects.

The .Core version has parts in it that the suffix-free legacy `JJ.Framework.PlatformCompatibility` is missing, and may still be relied on by certain projects.
