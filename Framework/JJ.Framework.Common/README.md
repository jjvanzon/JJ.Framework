JJ.Framework.Common
===================

A mixed bag of general-purpose utilities with minimal dependencies.
Later versions of this library split functionality into focused packages like `JJ.Framework.Text`, `JJ.Framework.Collections`, and `JJ.Framework.Exceptions`.

This "prequel" version, contains a little bit of everything: a version released in aid of releasing older legacy apps.

It has been updated for modern `.NET` versions and remains actively maintained and thoroughly tested.
