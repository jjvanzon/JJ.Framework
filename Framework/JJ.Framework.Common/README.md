JJ.Framework.Common
===================

A mixed bag of utilities with very little dependencies.  
In later versions this library is split into separate parts for instance `JJ.Framework.Text`, `JJ.Framework.Collections` and `JJ.Framework.Exceptions`.
This "prequel" version, contains a little bit of everything:
a version released in aid of releasing older legacy apps.
