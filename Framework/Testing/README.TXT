JJ.Framework.Testing contains a class AssertHelper, that mimics the Assert class from Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting. With that class you can do various value testing for your unit tests. The main thing the AssertHelper class adds, is that you can use expressions to identify which property you tested, which always gives you a neat error message identifying the tested expression, something that is very helpful when unit test assertions fail, and usually very laborious would you use the Assert class. With the AssertHelper class you get that for free.
