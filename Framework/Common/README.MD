Some basic helpers, for instance:

* `ConfigurationHelper`: For using configuration settings when you cannot be dependent on System.Configuration.
* `CultureHelper`: For instance to set thread culture with a single code line.
* `DoubleHelper`: For instance making parsing nullable doubles simpler.
* `EmbeddedResourceHelper`: Make is a little easier to get embedded resource Streams, bytes and strings.
* `EnumHelper`: Make calls to enum parsing and checking validitiy of enum values a little easier.
* `EventArgs<T>`: A generic version of event args. If you use a C#7 tuple for T you can basically use it every time you need event args.
* `Int32Helper`: For instance making parsing nullable ints simpler.
