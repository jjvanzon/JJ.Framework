# JJ.Framework.WinForms

Has a couple of controls in it and a form.

Most notably, the DiagramControl, which works with JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics, which allows you to use shapes and text with keyboard and mouse gestures to create a kind of interactive diagram or graphical editor. DiagramControl makes that usable in WinForms.

It also contains a less-than-perfect, but reusable Form for starting a process, possibly selecting an input file, with a cancel button possibility to show progress messages and stuff.
