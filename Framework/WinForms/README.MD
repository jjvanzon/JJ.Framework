# JJ.Framework.WinForms

Has a couple of `Controls` in it and a `Form`.

For instance a `DiagramControl`, which works with `JJ.Framework.VectorGraphics`, which allows you to use shapes and text with keyboard and mouse gestures to create a kind of interactive diagram or graphical editor. `DiagramControl` makes that usable in `WinForms`.

`FilePathControl` allows browsing for a file or folder or editing its path in a text box.

It also contains a less-than-perfect, but reusable `SimpleProcessForm` for starting a process, possibly selecting an input file, with a cancel button and possibility to show progress messages and stuff.
