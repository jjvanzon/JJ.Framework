JJ.Framework.PlatformCompatibility
==================================

Legacy component. A lingering relic for platform support, created before `.NET Standard` and `.NET 5` made things easier. It offered workarounds for compatibility issues on platforms like `iOS`, `Android`, and even `Windows Phone 8`. Mostly outdated now, but still linked to by various projects.
