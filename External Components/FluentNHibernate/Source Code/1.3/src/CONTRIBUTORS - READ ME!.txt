The wiki has a page on contributing to FNH:
http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Contributing

--IMPORTANT--
If you've just pulled the FNH code into a local git repository for the first time, its really important that you set the core.autocrlf setting to false to avoid running into whitespace/line ending issues. Do this using the following command:

  git config core.autocrlf false
