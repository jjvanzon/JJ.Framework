* `JJ.Framework.Conversion.1.0.6636.31479.nupkg` was published on nuget.org, but accidentally included a .tt file, which is for code generation.
* `JJ.Framework.IO.1.0.6636.38227.nupkg` was published on nuget.org, but had an error in the dependency information. It said '`JJ.Framework.Exception`' instead of '`JJ.Framework.Exceptions`'. It was missing an 's'.
