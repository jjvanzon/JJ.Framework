📢 Introduction
----------------

`JJ.Framework` are extensions of the `.NET Framework`: the nuts, bolts and screws of software development: *reusable components*. Some of which might be expected to be there in `.NET`, but seem to be missing there.

`JJ.Framework` contains reusable code, that was produced along with real-life applications.


🏋️ Stability
-------------

No software is bug free, but extra effort was made, testing the `JJ.Framework` components, that were published to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/jjvanzon) which includes automated testing.

The ones not on NuGet are available as a sneek peek in [JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed](https://dev.azure.com/jjvanzon/JJs-Software/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=JJs-Pre-Release-Package-Feed). But those may be used with caution, because they may not be tested that well. Those may need some more unit testing and could still be a bug or two in it.


🏡 In-House
------------

`JJ.Framework` was made in the spirit of: small things: develop your own, instead of importing a huge framework.

`JJ.Framework` components are compact: a couple of kilobytes each.

Developed *in-house* so that it could be adapted and extended as needed. It did not have to be complete, because then we would just extend it.

If a bug was found in the development of an app, we could just correct the `JJ.Framework` as needed and release a stable app.

Of course, this 'in-house development' argument does not apply, when other people use it. But I think these extensions could be of use to others too.


🏛️ History
-----------

Any reusable code independent of a particular business domain, was moved to this `JJ.Framework`, for reuse. The reusable code was gathered up between 2010 and 2025. It was a hobby project. But something similar to this framework, was also developed professionally in a team of 7 of which I was the technical lead at the time.


🍱 Modularization
------------------

`JJ.Framework` tends to have a separate assembly for each part of the `.NET Framework` that it extends. Separation may be found between technical aspects. That may allow being specific, on which parts of `.NET` an application becomes dependent.

`JJ.Framework` also likes to decouple platform-specific implementation details and hide them behind generalized interfaces.


💁 Platform Compatibility
--------------------------

That grip on dependency, was once a good plan for platform compatibility. Some of `JJ.Framework` is still based on `.NET 4.6.1` trying to keep it compatible with `Mono`. Around 2015 `JJ.Framework` was tested to be reasonably compatible with `Mono` and by extension `Android`, `iOS` and `Windows Phone`. This was before newer technology like `.NET Standard` and `.NET 5 +` emerged, which could make platform-compatibility a bit easier than before. For this reason, some of the `JJ.Framework` is currently being ported to a newer `.NET`, but this is still an ongoing process.
